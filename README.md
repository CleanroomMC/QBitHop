# QBitHop

a fork of [BitHop](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bithop).

Which claims to have low lag hoppers, which is only true to a certain extent. This fork aims to improve the performance
even further. Additionally this fork does not use kotlin (effectively removing the forgelin dependency).

### BitHop

BitHop is a mod to add simple, lag-free hopper alternatives. They don't pull from inventories or pick up items from the ground, so they're perfect for making long hopper chains while still staying in an easy, vanilla style!

Now included are the PullHop (pulls items from chests while skipping intensive entity checks), the FluxHop (transfers RF as well as items), and the ScrewHop (transfers items up and forward).
